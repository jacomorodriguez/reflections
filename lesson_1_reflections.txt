Q:
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

On the pro side, you wont have not-function versions of the code saved, also your saved versions will have a logical change to the last version. On the con side, if you forget to commit, the changes in your files will add up and when you finaly do it, it ll take for ever to go through them and commit them seperatly.
