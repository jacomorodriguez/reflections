Q:
How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

A:
Viewing a diff between two versions of a file helps to find bugs, 
because you just get a view of the lines which are not similar in the two versions. 

Comparing this two lines, and the changes which you made will speed up
debugging.

Q:
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

A:
On the pro side, you wont have not-function versions of the code saved, also your saved versions will have a logical change to the last version. On the con side, if you forget to commit, the changes in your files will add up and when you finaly do it, it ll take for ever to go through them and commit them seperatly.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

A:
